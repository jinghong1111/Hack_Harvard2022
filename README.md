# Hack_Harvard2022
This is our  entrey to Harvard Hack 2022. We are making a web app called __Price Ain't Cheap__ that, when given an input of a product name, it will search through a few online retailer websites and find the best deals from those sites, then sent it back the site for you to determine which one is the best purchase that suits your needs. 

Front-end: Coded with JS,CSS, HTML, and with React.js as the main framework.

Back-end: Coded with Python, and with Flask as the main framework. The data collect was done with BeautifulSoup Library.

NOTE: The website is sometimes glitchy because of the incompatibility between Router-05 and Router-06 in the React.js library, we are aware of this issue and are working on a fix.
